# Web Scoping Tool

Web Scoping Tool is a Python-based application for checking the status of websites, optionally checking for the presence of Web Application Firewalls (WAF), and taking screenshots of websites. The application is built with PyQt5 for the GUI, Selenium for web automation, and requests for HTTP requests. It also generates an HTML report of the results and provides voice notifications using pyttsx3.

## Features

- Enter a single URL or load multiple URLs from a text file.
- Optionally check for the presence of a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
- Take screenshots of the websites.
- Generate an HTML report summarizing the results.
- Voice notifications for start and completion of the web check.
- Dark mode UI with QDarkStyle.
